# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository.

This is a project proposed by Baraa Khatib Salkini, where we're building a Data Warehouse from scratch: We're loading data to a SQL Server database, where we're analyzing it, cleaning it and transforming it so the data can be utilized by final users.

In this case, we're using the Medallion Approach, where we're building 3 layers:
  
  * **Bronze**: Staging, Raw Data.
  * **Silver**: Clean and Transform.
  * **Gold**: Business Ready Objects.
